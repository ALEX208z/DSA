Approach for patterns questions

// Stiver A2Z
Patterns → nested loops
1. In the outer loop, count the number of lines.
2. In the inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows.
3. Print the "*" inside the inner for loop.
4. Observe symmetry {optional}


// Kunal Kushwaha
1. no. of lines = no. of rows
   = no. of times outer loop will run.
2. Identify for every row no.,
   - how many cols are there
   - Types of elements in col
3. What do you need to print
Note : Try to find the formula relating rows and columns
